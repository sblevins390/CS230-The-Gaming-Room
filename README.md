Software Design Document


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  
  The client in this project, The Gaming Room, is a gaming company that currently has a Android only mobile game called Draw It or Lose It. The goals of the client are to expand beyond Android to a web-based application with a client-server type architecture in a distributed system.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  
  Overall, I feel that I did pretty well with the entire document, however i felt most confident in the executive summary and domain model description. The executive summary analyzed the minimal information from the client to describe the project mission, and the domain model description is accurate and thorough based on the provided UML class diagram.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
  Having the design document as a reference was helpful mainly as a guideline to ensure all requirements are met. It was very useful having a plan / summary to follow during development to stay on track and ensure all client requirements and concerns are met and addressed.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  Honestly, I am quite happy with my work on this design document and minimal revision would be done. I suppose that I would revise the evaluation section and perhaps spend more time researching the different platforms to find additional considerations.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  Based on the requirements provided by the client, I determined what operating systems would be supported, how the game would be hosted, considered varying demand on the server for the game, and of course considered information, and system security. These are important of course because the needs of the client is what this development project is all about. Constraints are provided to help the client meet their goals, and our goal is to make recommendations to assist in that, and implement those recommendations for presentation to the client.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
  I find that having a visual representation of the design (UML) makes it extremely easy to follow the structure of the program, and a lot can be accomplished simply by referencing the UML diagram. I started by coding the different classes along with their attributes, and functions to give a 'template' so to speak. The began working on functioning code by developing sections at a time and testing frequently to ensure all aspects worked properly together.
